### Ensure MetaMask is setup and the correct network is selected in which the coin is intended to be minted on.
- Go to https://metamask.io/download.html and install MetaMask
- Select Network (For testing, use something like the Ropsten Test Network; for Production use the Etherium Mainnet)
- Fund the Etherium wallet to ensure [Gas Fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) are covered when minting the new token.
  - If the Etherium wallet is on the Ropsten Test Network, a faucet may be used to fund the wallet. [Faucet link](https://faucet.ropsten.be/)
- Copy (keep note of) the funded Etherium Wallet Address

- Select the SHID token
- Click Send
- Copy/Paste the contract address of SHID into the address field.
- Fill out the number of tokens to give the contract. These tokens/coins will be available for purchase.

### How to determine SHIDDED coin's worth.
Thanks to smart contracts, there are automated algorithms ([Automated Market Makers](https://www.gemini.com/cryptopedia/amm-what-are-automated-market-makers)) that will value SHIDDED coin based on the amount of Etherium within the liquidity pool. There is a ratio of Etherium to SHIDD that will move the price. As more Etherium is held within the liquidity pool, the price of SHID increases. Those who decide to keep money within the liquidity pool are rewarded with interest.

### Add to exchange Liquitity Pools (Pancake Swap and Uniswap)

**Pancake Swap Liquidity through Binance Smart Chain**

When you add liquidity, you are given pool tokens representing your position. These tokens automatically earn fees proportional to your share of the pool, and can be redeemed at any time. Whenever someone trades PancakeSwap, the trader pays a 0.2% fee, of which 0.17% is added to the liquidity pool of the swap pair they traded on. To make being a liquidity provider even more worth your while, you can also put your LP tokens to work whipping up some fresh yield on the CAKE farms [here](https://pancakeswap.finance/), while still earning your 0.17% trading fee reward.
- Read documentation at https://docs.pancakeswap.finance/products/pancakeswap-exchange/pancakeswap-pools
- Go to https://exchange.pancakeswap.finance/#/pool
- Select "ETH" in the Input box and provide a value.
- Select "SHID" in the 2nd Input box and provide a value.
- Observe the price of "SHID" per "ETH"
- Click Approve (Gas Fees)
- Wait for an approval
- Once approved, click "Create Pool & Supply" (Gas Fees)



**Uniswap Liquidity through Etherium Block Chain**

Uniswap incentivises users to add liquidity to pools by rewarding liquidity providers with fees that are collected by the protocol. A 0.3% fee is taken for swapping between Ether and a token and roughly 0.6% is token for token to tokens swaps.

- Read documentation at https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/introduction/liquidity-user-guide
- Go to https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool
- Click 'New Position'
- Select Pair 'ETH' and 'SHID'
- Select Fee Tier (1% seems fitting as this is best for exotic pairs; SHIDDED is exotic)
- Set Starting Price (only required for new pools) - This should be the accurate market price of each token.
- Set Price Range
    - Set Min Price
    - Set Max Price
    - Observe the Current Price
- Deposit Amounts
- Approve and Add
 - Click 'Confirm' in MetaMask

    - Instead Uniswap uses the Exchange contracts to pool both Ether and a specific ERC20. When trading Ether for a token, Ether is sent to the contractâ€™s pool and the token is given back to the user. As a result, the user doesnâ€™t need to wait for a counterparty in order to exchange or worry about specifying a price. Since anyone can list a token and users don't need to worry about matching with someone else, it is very easy to avoid any bootstrapping issue when first launching a token. The amount that is returned from swapping is based on an automated market maker formula. The graph below helps illustrate how the formula works. Essentially, the amount that is returned to you is based on the ratio of Ether to token in the pool. No matter the size of a swap, the user is guaranteed to have their trade execute because the more of an asset that you add to one side of the pool, the further along the curve it pushes you for the other asset. Meaning the larger the order relative to the pool, the worst rate you will receive as the ratio moves along the curve.
