### Ensure MetaMask is setup and the correct network is selected in which the coin is intended to be minted on.
- Go to https://metamask.io/download.html and install MetaMask
- Select Network (For testing, use something like the Ropsten Test Network; for Production use the Etherium Mainnet)
- Fund the Ethereum wallet to ensure [Gas Fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) are covered when minting the new token.
  - If the Ethereum wallet is on the Ropsten Test Network, a faucet may be used to fund the wallet. [Faucet link](https://faucet.ropsten.be/)
- Copy (keep note of) the funded Etherium Wallet Address

### Developing the Shidded coin ERC-20 token in Remix online IDE
- Open Ethereum's Remix Tool https://remix.ethereum.org/
- Ensure MetaMask Chrome Browser extension is installed and Ethereum has been funded to the wallet of the future ERC-20 token owner.
- Create a new file (*SHID-20.sol*)
- Copy/Paste the following smart contract details (Note: There are 18 decimal places for this token, so the number of coins created is 500 Billion).
    ```
    pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

    import "https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

    contract SHIDDED is ERC20 {
      constructor () ERC20 ("Shidded Coin", "SHID"){
        _mint(msg.sender, 500000000000000000000000000000);
      }
    }
    ```
    - Click 'Solidity Compiler'
    - Ensure 'Compiler' is set to 0.8.1+commit.df193b15
    - Click 'Compile shid-20.sol'
    - Click 'Deploy and Run Transactions'
    - Select environment 'Injected Web3' -- This should cause a prompt which asks for approval to connect Remix with MetaMask (Click Next > Connect)
    - Select Account (The Ethereum address should match what is in MetaMask)
    - Select Contract 'Shidded - shid-20.sol'
    - Click Deploy
    
    ###### From here, MetaMask will take over...
    - MetaMask will ask you to confirm the contract deployment along with gas fees; Click Confirm.
    - Confirm that the contract was successfully deployed through Remix's console output and MetaMasks Chrome notifications.
        - Expand the block from the console output; copy the hash of the transaction for later use.

    - The status should say 'Success'
    - Other field values: Block, Timestamp, From, Interacted With (To), Tokens Transferred, Value, Transaction Fee, Gas Price
- Click the 'Interacted With (To)' hash link.
    - Observe and confirm the correct Token Tracker (Name and Ticker) as well as the Contract Creator.
    - Observe the Txn Hash and Block showing the Contract Creation event.
- Click the Token Tracker URL
    - Observe the following fields: Contract, Max Total Supply, Holders, Transfers.

### Add the custom token to MetaMask
The Best Way:
- [Download and install the MetaMask Chrome extension](https://metamask.io/download)
- Navigate to [shid.diamonds](https://shid.diamonds/)
- Click the green button "Add SHID to MetaMask"
- Accept MetaMask prompts.

The Manual Way:

- Verify the token symbol "SHID" is displayed.
- Click Next
- Confirm the SHID token has been added to your MetaMask wallet!

___

### Transfer SHID coins from the creator's address to the smart contract address
Once the coin is provisioned, all belong to the asset creator. At this point in time, no one can buy the coin because the creator owns them all! It will be important to transfer coins back to the contract address so they are available to be purchased on the market!
- Open MetaMask-
- Select the SHID token
- Click Send
- Copy/Paste the contract address of SHID into the address field.
- Fill out the number of tokens to give the contract. These tokens/coins will be available for purchase.
- Click Next
- Acknowledge [Gas Fees](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/gas/) and click "Confirm"
- The transaction will go to pending. Within a short amount of time, the transaction will be finish and the contract will own the tokens transferred.

### How to determine Shidded coin's worth.
"[Automated Market Makers](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/automated-market-maker-amm)" are what determines 
the price of Shidded Coin. Automated market makers are smart contracts that create a liquidity pool of ERC-20 tokens, 
which are automatically traded by an algorithm rather than an order book. This effectively replaces a traditional limit order-book 
with a system where assets can be automatically swapped against the pool's latest price.

### Add to exchange Liquitity Pools (Uniswap)

**Uniswap Liquidity through Ethereum Block Chain**

Uniswap incentivises users to add liquidity to pools by rewarding liquidity providers with fees that are collected by the protocol. A 0.3% fee is taken for swapping between Ether and a token and roughly 0.6% is taken for token to tokens swaps.

- Read documentation at https://docs.uniswap.org/concepts/introduction/liquidity-user-guide
- Go to https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool
- Click 'New Position'
- Select Pair 'ETH' and 'SHID'
- Select Fee Tier (1% seems fitting as this is best for exotic pairs; Shidded is exotic)
- Set Starting Price (only required for new pools) - This should be the accurate market price of each token.
- Set Price Range
    - Set Min Price
    - Set Max Price
    - Observe the Current Price
- Deposit Amounts
- Approve and Add
 - Click 'Confirm' in MetaMask

    - Instead Uniswap uses the Exchange contracts to pool both Ether and a specific ERC20. When trading Ether for a token, Ether is sent to the contract’s pool and the token is given back to the user. As a result, the user doesn’t need to wait for a counterparty in order to exchange or worry about specifying a price. Since anyone can list a token and users don't need to worry about matching with someone else, it is very easy to avoid any bootstrapping issue when first launching a token. The amount that is returned from swapping is based on an automated market maker formula. The graph below helps illustrate how the formula works. Essentially, the amount that is returned to you is based on the ratio of Ether to token in the pool. No matter the size of a swap, the user is guaranteed to have their trade execute because the more of an asset that you add to one side of the pool, the further along the curve it pushes you for the other asset. Meaning the larger the order relative to the pool, the worst rate you will receive as the ratio moves along the curve.
